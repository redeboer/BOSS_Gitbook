See [Modules](https://redeboer.github.io/BOSS_Afterburner/group__BOSS__Afterburner.html) on the Doxygen class documentation pages. Aims:

* Simplify the usual steps of final event selection macros:
  * [Loading](loading.md)
  * [Cutting](cutting.md)
  * [Drawing](drawing.md)
  * [Fitting](fitting.md)
* Facilitate collaboration on final selection analysis code \(see [Contributing](../contributing.md)\).
