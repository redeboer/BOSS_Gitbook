# About

From October 2018 to May 2019, I will be doing my master research at the BESIII Collaboration as a visiting master student from [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/experimental-physics) \(The Netherlands\). Because I, like many others, will spend a lot of time getting used to the BOSS framework and several related analysis tools used within the BESIII Collaboration, I decided to publish my notes and code on [GitHub](https://github.com/redeboer/BOSS_Afterburner) and [GitBook](https://besiii.gitbook.io/boss-gitbook). In addition, I found that little documentation exists about the BOSS Analysis Framework \(particularly in English\), which is why the GitBook pages became more like a tutorial. I hope that the resulting documentation can be of use to anyone who wants to get familiar with BOSS or with analysis of BESIII data in general.

In writing the code for my analysis, I have attempted to set up an object-oriented `C++` class structure that is as general in usage as possible. I hope that this allows other members of BESIII to collaborate on the framework that I am building op. Since this code contains `Doxygen` formatted comments, there is an [additional page](https://redeboer.github.io/BOSS_Afterburner/) with documentation on the class structure of that analysis code. In this way, I hope that the class documentation in this repository can also be used to help the user understand the BOSS framework itself and, more importantly, that it can serve as a help to fellow students starting to do analysis on BESIII data.
