# Required fields

## Names of input root files

One file per line, without tailing characters, such as comma, semicolon and period. Just like in the `TChain::Add()` method, absolute, relative paths, and wildcards \(`[]?*`\) are supported.

## Tree name

Name of the `TTree` that contains the MC truth data. Usually, this tree has been written by the `MctruthForTopo`algorithm and is called `"MctruthForTopoAna"`.

## Branch name of the number of particles

This branch is required for reading the two arrays specified below. In the `MctruthForTopo` package, it is called `"Nmcps"`.

## Branch name of the array of particle identifications

Usually called `"Pid"` in the `MctruthForTopo` package.

## Branch name of the array of the mother indeces of particles

Usually called `"Midx"` in the `MctruthForTopo` package.

## Main name of output files

When you run `topoana.exe`, four files with the same name but in different formats \(root/txt/tex/pdf\) will be written as output. The filename extensions are appended automatically, so it is not necessary to add these extensions to this field.
