## Designing decay cards

When generating a Monte Carlo sample, a decay card \(usual extension: `dec`\) can be used to overwrite the decay of certain particles. This allows you to generate a Monte Carlo sample that only contains events with the signal topology which you are studying.

A decay card is a text file that lists certain particle decays. If your decay card specifies the decay channels of a certain particle, the 'normal' decay channels \(those listed in the PDG\) for that particle will be overwritten. The decay channels of one particle should follow this pattern:

```text
Decay <particle name>
  <branching fraction 1> <daughter 1a> <daughter 1b> <generator> <parameters>;
  <branching fraction 2> <daughter 2a> <daughter 2b ><generator> <parameters>;
Enddecay
```

Here, there are only two decay channels, but you can add more of course. Note that a decay card **has to end with the line**:

```text
End

```

Due to a small bug in BOSS, **a decay card has to end in with an empty white line**, otherwise the simulation job will crash.

If you do not specify the decay channels of a certain particle, the decay card called `DECAY.dec` in the `BesEvtGen` package will be used. This file essentially follows the PDG listings. In addition, definitions of particles \(including their physical widths\) can be found in the file `pdt.table`. Both files are located here \(in the case of BOSS 7.0.4\):
