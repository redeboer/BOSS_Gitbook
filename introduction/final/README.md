# Final event selection

{% hint style="warning" %}
These pages will sketch some usual procedures of analysis _after_ an initial event selection has been performed using BOSS. The final event selection is usually made outside of BOSS and has therefore not been widely documented.

The aim of these pages is to provide a clear overview and motivation of the key aspects that go into the more practical details behind memos and publications by BESIII.
