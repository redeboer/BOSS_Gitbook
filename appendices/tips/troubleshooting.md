# Troubleshooting

### \*\*\*\*

### **I lost read-write access in my`afs` home folder**

Formerly, this problem could be solved using the `klog` command. Since August 2019, this command has become:

```bash
kinit $USER
aklog -d
```

You should now be able to read-write in _all_ your sessions.

### I'm sure my job is set up correctly, but it keeps resulting in:

```text
JobOptionsSvc       ERROR # =======> <package>/share/jobOptions_<package>.txt
JobOptionsSvc       ERROR # (22,1): parse error
...
JobOptionsSvc       FATAL Job options errors.
ApplicationMgr      FATAL Error initializing JobOptionsSvc
```

Yep, this is a weird one... So far, the cause was usually that the `jobOptions_*.txt` ends in a comment. You can solve it by adding a new line to the file.

### I cannot run a bash script, but I'm sure it should work

It could be that you wrote the `.sh` script on Windows and the file wasn't stored with Linux line endings. You can change these line endings back to Linux using:

```bash
sed -i 's/\r$//' $fileName
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This command is also available is used `source` to load [`jobs/CommonFunctions.sh`](https://github.com/redeboer/BOSS_IniSelect/blob/master/jobs/CommonFunctions.sh), you can use the function `ChangeLineEndingsFromWindowsToUnix`.
{% endhint %}

### Some header files are not found when compiling my package

Check your `requirements` file. Packages that you need should be declared here as well. For instance, if you want to use `McTruth` packages such as `McParticle.h`, you should add the line:

{% code title="requirements" %}
```text
use McTruth     McTruth-*     Event
```
{% endcode %}

### I am not the right group for submitting jobs

If you receive the error message

```text
hep_sub: error: argument -g/--group: invalid choice: 'physics' (choose from 'gpupwa', 'mlgpu')
```

or something with different group names, it means you are in the wrong job submit group. Write an email to Ms. Wen Shuoping to ask to be put in the group `physics` \(or whatever group you need\).

### No resources in job submit group

 If you receive the error message

```text
No resources in your group(s). So the job can not be submitted.
```

you should ask to be put in a different group \(probably `physhics`\). Write an email to Ms. Wen Shuoping.

### I cannot submit a job through `boss.condor` or `hep_sub` but see `ERROR: Failed to create new proc id` instead

Two known causes:

1. In the case of `hep_sub`, you should submit an **executable** bash script. Make the `sh` script executable using `chmod +x`. Use `boss.condor` in exactly the same way as `boss.exe`, that is, feed it a job options file \(`txt`\), not a bash script.
2. You sourced a bash script that contained an `export -f`statement \(exporting a bash `function`\). While this is correct way of exporting a function, it somehow affects BOSS. Change this statement into `export` \(omit the `f` option\) and the issue is fixed.

### I cannot run `boss.exe` without jobs

It should be possible to run `boss.exe` without jobs \(see [here](../../tutorials/getting-started/setup.md#step-6-test-boss-using-boss-exe)\). Does it result in the following error message?

```text
boss.exe: error while loading shared libraries: libReflex.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

If so, you probably forgot to [source `TestRelease`](../../tutorials/getting-started/setup.md#step-5-implement-the-testrelease-package).

### I get a message about `sysInitialize()` when running a job

If you receive the following error message:

```text
**************************************************
               BOSS version: 7.0.4
************** BESIII Collaboration **************

the jobOptions file is : jobOptions_sim.txt
JobOptionsSvc       FATAL in sysInitialize(): standard std::exception is caught
JobOptionsSvc       ERROR locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name not valid
ApplicationMgr      FATAL Error initializing JobOptionsS
```

it means you have encountered another nasty bug. It could have something to do with the environment of the terminal with which you log in: in the case of Windows, it is known to appear when [using the `wsl` terminal](./#compiling-on-windows-10). Try a different terminal \(such as [`git bash`](https://gitforwindows.org/)\) and the problem might disappear. It's magic!  
_Update_: in Linux, the trick doesn't seem to work...



### I cannot use a graphical interface from `lxslc`

If, for instance, you cannot view a `TBrowser` or cannot open the event display `besvis.exe`, but instead see

```text
In case you run from a remote ssh session, reconnect with ssh -Y
```

you probably logged in with an SSH key and even using `ssh -Y`won't help. If you really need the graphical interfaces from `lxslc`, you will need to remove your public key from the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file \(just open and edit, it's just a text file\) and log in again.
