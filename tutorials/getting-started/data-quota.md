# Data quota

When you have logged into the server, you usually start in your home \(`~`\) folder. Move to the root of the server \(`cd /`\) and you'll see that is a large number of other directories. A few of these directories contain space that is assigned to your user account. Here is an overview:

| Path | Data quota | Max. number of files | Remark |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `/afs/ihep.ac.cn/users/<letter>/$USER` | 500 MB | NA | home \(`~`\) |
| `/besfs/users/$USER` | 50 GB | 300,000 |  |
| `/ihepbatch/bes/$USER` | 200 MB | NA |  |
| `/workfs/bes/$USER` | 5 GB | 50,000 | no `hep_sub` available |
| `/scratchfs/bes/$USER` | \(500 GB\) | NA | max. 2 weeks\* |

\* In practice, files remain on this server indefinitely. In fact, `scratchfs` seems to follow a less strict policy then other folders.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Do not exceed these quotas!** If you do, the folder of which you are exceeding its quota will be locked by the Computing Center after a few weeks and it is quite a hassle to regain access.
{% endhint %}
