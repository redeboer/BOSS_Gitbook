# The IHEP server \(lxslc\)

Within BESIII, most analysis tasks are run on a server that is hosted by [IHEP](../../appendices/glossary.md#ihep). The server is also where you will use BOSS. You will need to [apply for an IHEP computing account](https://docbes3.ihep.ac.cn/~offlinesoftware/index.php/Lxslc_account_application) to be able to log in.

## Accessing the server

The IHEP server runs on [Scientific Linux CERN](https://linux.web.cern.ch/linux/scientific.shtml) \(SLC\). The server offers several versions. Usually, people use either SLC5, SLC6, or SLC7. The domain names for these are `lxslc6.ihep.ac.cn`, where the `6` in this case refers to SLC6. If you are running on Linux or a Linux terminal, the server can be easily accessed using:

```bash
ssh -Y <your user name>@lxslc6.ihep.ac.cn
```

Here, the option `-Y` ensures _X11 forwarding_, allowing you to open graphical applications from the server.

If you don't like having to enter your password every time you log in, have a look at the section [Key generation in Tips & Tricks](../../appendices/tips/#key-generation-for-ssh).
{% endhint %}

In Windows, there are some nice tools that allow you to access the server. First of all, to be able to use SSH, use will either have to use [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) or more extensive software like [Xmanager](https://www.netsarang.com/products/xmg_overview.html). You can also just search for some Linux terminals for Windows. In addition, I would recommend you to work with the \(S\)FTP client [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php). It allows you to easily navigate the file structure of the IHEP server and to quickly transfer---even synchronise---files up and down to your own computer.

{% hint style="info" %}
Once in the server, you can switch to other versions of SLC using `hep_container`. So for instance, if you are in SLC7 \(CentOS\) and want to use SL6, you can use:

`hep_container shell SL6`

where `shell` can be replaced with your shell of choice.

## Important data paths

Some other important directories for the BESIII Collaboration are the following:

* [BOSS Software directory](https://docbes3.ihep.ac.cn/~offlinesoftware/index.php/How_to_setup_BOSS_environment_on_lxslc)
  * `/afs/ihep.ac.cn/bes3/offline/Boss` \(also referred to with `$BesArea`\)
* [Raw data files](https://docbes3.ihep.ac.cn/~offlinesoftware/index.php/Raw_Data)
  * `/bes3fs/offline/data/raw`
  * `/besfs/offline/data/randomtrg` \(random trigger data\)
* [Reconstructed data sets](https://docbes3.ihep.ac.cn/~offlinesoftware/index.php/Production)
  * `/besfs3/offline/data/`
  * `/besfs/offline/data/` \(older versions\)
* [Reconstructed Monte Carlo sets](https://docbes3.ihep.ac.cn/~offlinesoftware/index.php/Jpsi_data) \(latest version available is `6.6.4`\):
  *  `/besfs2/offline/data/664-1/jpsi/09mc/dst` \(2009; 225M\)
  *  `/besfs2/offline/data/664-1/jpsi/12mc/dst` \(2012; 200M\)
  *  `/besfs2/offline/data/664-1/jpsi/12mc/grid/dst` \(2012; 800M\)
  * \(no reconstructed MC samples available yet for 2018\)

These directories will be important later in this 'tutorial'.
