# Inclusive Monte Carlo samples

## Reconstructed $$J/\psi$$ samples

The latest $$J/\psi$$ samples have been reconstructed with **BOSS 6.6.4**. They are located here:

```bash
InclJpsi="/besfs3/offline/data/besfs2/offline/data/664-1/jpsi/"
```

| Year | Round | Inclusive **MC** | Subfolder |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | :--- |
| 2009 | `round02` | $$225 \times 10^6$$\`\` | `$InclJpsi/09mc/dst` |
| 2012 | `round05` | $$1.0 \times 10^9$$  | `$InclJpsi/12mc/dst` |
| 2017–2018 | `round11` | $$0.3 \times 10^9$$ | _hasn't been reconstructed yet_ |
| 2018–2019 | `round12` | $$10 \times 10^9$$ | _hasn't been reconstructed yet_ |
