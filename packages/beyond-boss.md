# Beyond BOSS

## BEAN

> BEAN is a ROOT-based analysis framework designed for the BES3 experiment. **BEAN** stands for the **BE**S3 **AN**alysis. The goal is to develop a lightweight analysis software, more simple and easy to use than BOSS. It is not a replacement of BOSS simulation and reconstruction software. Currently BEAN supports KinematicFit , ParticleID, MagneticField, EventTag and AbsCor analysis tools ported from BOSS. BEAN is capable for the parallel computing, and supports PROOF in very transparent way.
