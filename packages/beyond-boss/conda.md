# Conda

The `lxslc` server has a very outdated version of Python. If you do want to use Python 3, you can work with Conda, which is available on the server. Just add the following script:

{% code title="conda\_env.sh" %}
```bash
__conda_setup="$('/cvmfs/mlgpu.ihep.ac.cn/anaconda3/bin/conda' 'shell.bash' 'hook' 2> /dev/null)"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  eval "$__conda_setup"
else
  if [ -f "/cvmfs/mlgpu.ihep.ac.cn/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
    . "/cvmfs/mlgpu.ihep.ac.cn/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
  else
    export PATH="/cvmfs/mlgpu.ihep.ac.cn/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
  fi
fi
unset __conda_setup
```
{% endcode %}

You can then source it through whatever means you prefer, like creating an alias `alias condaenv="source <path_to_script>/conda_env.sh"`  in your `.bashrc`.

Next, just run `conda activate tensorflow-gpu` and you have `python3`, `ipython` and even `import tensorflow` available! \(At the time of writing, TensorFlow is version 1.13.1 though.\)

Unfortunately, you don't have the rights to `conda create` new environments. To see which other environments are available, use `conda info --envs`.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't want to go through this whole hassle \(it's quite slow indeed\), and just want to use `python3`, you could also just add`/cvmfs/mlgpu.ihep.ac.cn/anaconda3/envs/tensorflow/bin` to your `PATH`. But keep in mind that you may run into trouble with certain Python libraries!
{% endhint %}
