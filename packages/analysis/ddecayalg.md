# DDecayAlg

`DDecayAlg` is an algorithm used by BESIII to create `NTuple`s to be used in charm analysis \(e.g. $$D\to K_S^0 h^+h^-$$.

It is located in `BesExamples` of BOSS and mainly uses the `DTagTool` package to perform `tagged` analysis of D mesons.

## DTagTool

The algorithm starts the `DTagTool` algorithm

```text
DTagTool dtagTool;
```

`DTagTool` has information about tagged decays at BESIII, used at the $$\psi(3770)\to D^0 \bar{D}^0$$ decay mode. We can either look at the "single tag" or "stag" which looks at the decay $$D^0(\bar{D}^0) \to f$$ where we include both $$D^0$$ and $$\bar{D}^0$$.

Let's take the $$K_{S}^{0} \pi^+ \pi^-$$ decay, which `DTagTool` assigns the decay mode `"100"`:

```text
EvtRecDTag * stag = dtagTool.findSTag(100);
```

This `stag` object now has the information relating to the candidate decay $$D\to K_S^0 \pi^+ \pi^-$$ such as $$\Delta E = E_\text{beam} - E_D$$:

```text
deltaE = stag->deltaE();
```

or the tracks from the event

```text
tracks = stag->tracks();
```
