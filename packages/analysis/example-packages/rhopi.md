## What does this example package teach?

The `RhopiAlg` is the starting point for beginners using BOSS. It teaches:

* The usual Gaudi [`Algorithm`](https://dayabay.bnl.gov/dox/GaudiKernel/html/classAlgorithm.html) structure of the [`initialize`](https://dayabay.bnl.gov/dox/GaudiKernel/html/classAlgorithm.html#ab889608fa1b738d0dbfef7751e8598ae), [`execute`](https://dayabay.bnl.gov/dox/GaudiKernel/html/classIAlgorithm.html#a751b04dd35a3877d8799fcd07d0a6892), and [`finalize`](https://dayabay.bnl.gov/dox/GaudiKernel/html/classAlgorithm.html#a9ffbd123ceb6c35e7c0344428d911fdc) steps.
* The use of logging using [`MsgStream`](https://dayabay.bnl.gov/dox/GaudiKernel/html/classMsgStream.html).

## Introduction

One of the basic physics analysis packages that is already provided in BOSS is the `RhopiAlg` package. Within BESIII, almost everyone knows it, because it is used as the starting point for developing your own initial event selection packages. `RhopiAlg` is an illustration of a typical procedure in particle physics: reconstructing a decayed particle. For this, you will have to make apply cuts on measured parameters and this package is an illustration of this procedure.

The `RhopiAlg` analyses the decay of the $$\rho(770)$$ meson. As you can see in the in the [PDG listing for this meson](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2018/listings/rpp2018-list-rho-770.pdf), the $$\rho(770)$$ meson predominantly decays through $$\rho\rightarrow\pi\pi$$ \(almost $$100\%$$\), whether it concerns a $$\rho^+$$ , $$\rho^0$$ , or $$\rho^-$$. This means that we can reconstruct this meson purely through this _2-particle decay mode_.

Additionally, when we consider the charged $$\rho^\pm$$ mesons, one of the decay products is the neutral pion: $$\rho^\pm \rightarrow \pi^\pm\pi^0$$. This meson is again neutral and cannot be detected, so has to be reconstructed. But here again, there is one dominant decay mode: $$\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$$ \($$98.823 \pm 0.034 \%$$, see [its PDG listing](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2018/listings/rpp2018-list-pi-zero.pdf)\). This means that we can reconstruct the $$\rho^\pm$$ meson almost exclusively through its $$\rho^\pm \rightarrow \pi^\pm\pi^0 \rightarrow \pi^\pm\gamma\gamma$$ decay channel.

In reconstructing $$\pi^0$$ and $$\rho^0$$, you will run into another common phenomenon in hadron research: the width of the decaying particle. The width of $$\rho^0$$ is much wider than $$\pi^0$$ and therefore results in interesting differences in the eventual invariant mass spectra. In the final event selection, you will for instance see that a fit of the invariant mass peaks results in different widths.

## Where to find it?

The original `RhopiAlg` package \(version `0.0.23`\) is located here,

```text
/afs/ihep.ac.cn/bes3/offline/Boss/$BOSSVERSION/Analysis/Physics/RhopiAlg/RhopiAlg-00-00-23
```

You can also [find the `RhopiAlg` package in the BOSS Tutorials repository](https://github.com/redeboer/BOSS_Tutorials/tree/master/RhopiAlg/RhopiAlg-00-00-23).

## How to compile and run?

See [summary of Set up a BOSS package](../../../tutorials/getting-started/setup-package.md#summary) and [Running jobs](../../../tutorials/getting-started/jobs.md). An [example of a analysis job option file for `RhopiAlg`](https://github.com/redeboer/BOSS_IniSelect_ORIGINAL/blob/b48291704f1b1df6a9953fd50689b9039f064815/workarea/TestRelease/TestRelease-00-00-00/run/jobOptions_ana_rhopi.txt)is found under `run` [in the `TestRelease` package](../../../tutorials/getting-started/setup-package.md#the-testrelease-package).

The parameter `EventCnvSvc.digiRootInputFile` lists the input files. This is currently `rhopi.dst` \(namely the output after running the [`jobOptions_rec.txt`job](https://github.com/redeboer/BOSS_IniSelect_ORIGINAL/blob/b48291704f1b1df6a9953fd50689b9039f064815/workarea/TestRelease/TestRelease-00-00-00/run/jobOptions_rec.txt)\), but you can also feed it other DST files, such as [the ones reconstructed from BESIII data or inclusive Monte Carlo samples](../../../tutorials/getting-started/server.md#important-data-paths).

## Description of source code

{% hint style="warning" %}
The sections below are incomplete and it is not yet decided whether it is useful to describe the source code in words. For now, you can also have a look at [this class description](https://redeboer.github.io/BOSS_IniSelect_ORIGINAL/classRhopiAlg.html#a93c6042360744cee6c886ee0ba985504) \(redirects to `execute` step of the algorithm\). Scroll down a bit, and you can also navigate to the corresponding source code \(in this case, [line 478](https://redeboer.github.io/BOSS_IniSelect_ORIGINAL/RhopiAlg_8cxx_source.html#l00478)\), which has slightly improved comments compared to version `00-00-23`.

### Declaring and defining properties like cuts

See [header `.h` file](https://github.com/redeboer/BOSS_IniSelect_ORIGINAL/blob/b48291704f1b1df6a9953fd50689b9039f064815/workarea/Analysis/Physics/RhopiAlg/RhopiAlg-01-00-00/RhopiAlg/RhopiAlg.h#L42) for declarations and [source `.cxx` code](https://github.com/redeboer/BOSS_IniSelect_ORIGINAL/blob/master/workarea/Analysis/Physics/RhopiAlg/RhopiAlg-01-00-00/src/RhopiAlg.cxx) for definitions of cuts.

### Writing properties

### Looping over charged and neutral tracks

### Kalman kinematic $$n$$-constraints fit procedure

* `fit4c` refers to the 4-constraints coming from the original $$\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$$ meson \(or other mesons, depending on the collision energy\), namely, the 4-momentum of the system \(collision energy and sum of the 3-momenta\). Note that the $$\chi^2_\text{red}$$ of the fit is the same for any combination, as the for constraints are the same in each event.
* `fit5c`  is used when an additional constraint is applied. In the `Rhopi` package, this fifth constraint refers to the constraint reconstruction of $$\rho^\pm \rightarrow \pi^\pm\pi^0 \rightarrow \pi^\pm\gamma\gamma$$, namely the mass of the pion.
